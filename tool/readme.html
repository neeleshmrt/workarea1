<h1><a name=Introduction>Introduction</a></h1>

<p>In late 1999, I had my first encounter with extended SQL trace, through the Oracle Support note <em>Interpreting Raw SQL_TRACE and
 DBMS_SUPPORT.START_TRACE output</em> (39817.1). From the beginning, it was clear that the information it provided was essential for 
 understanding what an application is doing when it's connected to Oracle Database. At the same time, I was very disappointed that no 
 tool was available for analyzing extended SQL trace files for the purpose of leveraging their content. I should note that TKPROF at 
 that time didn't provide information about wait events. After spending too much time manually extracting information from the raw 
 trace files through command-line tools like awk, I decided to write my own analysis tool: TVD$XTAT.</p>

<p>Currently, TKPROF provides information about wait events, but it still has five major problems that are addressed in TVD$XTAT:</p>
<ul>
  <li>As soon as the <em>sort</em> argument is specified, the relationship between SQL statements is lost.</li>
  <li>Data is provided only in aggregated form. Consequently, useful information is lost.</li>
  <li>No information about bind variables is provided.</li>
  <li>Idle wait events (for example, <em>SQL*Net message from client</em>) taking place during the
      execution of a SQL statement aren't accounted for in the elapsed time shown by TKPROF. As
      a result, when SQL statements are sorted according to their elapsed time, the output might be
      misleading or, in extreme cases, very time consuming if not nearly impossible to interpret.</li>
  <li>When a trace file doesn't contain the text of a SQL statement (specifically, the text delimited
      between the PARSING IN CURSOR and END OF STMT keywords), TKPROF doesn't report the
      details about the SQL statement; it just accounts for the resource utilization in the summary at
      the end of the output file. Note that one case in which the text of a SQL statement isn't stored
      in the trace file is when SQL trace is activated after the execution has already been started.</li>
</ul>

  Java Runtime Environment 1.5.0 or newer.

<h1><a name=Installation>Installation</a></h1>

<p>Here's how to install TVD$XTAT:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Download TVD$XTAT from <a href="http://top.antognini.ch">http://top.antognini.ch</a>.</li>
  <li>Uncompress the distribution file into an empty directory of your choice.</li>
  <li>In the shell script used to start TVD$XTAT (either <b style='font-family:"Courier New"'>
      <a href="tvdxtat.cmd">tvdxtat.cmd</a></b> 
      or <b style='font-family:"Courier New"'><a href="tvdxtat.sh">tvdxtat.sh</a></b>, depending
      on your operating system), modify the variables <b style='font-family:"Courier New"'>java_home</b>
      and <b style='font-family:"Courier New"'>tvdxtat_home</b>. The former references the directory where 
      a Java Runtime Environment is installed. The latter references the directory 
      where the distribution file was uncompressed.</li>
  <li>Optionally, change the default value of the command-line arguments. To do that, you need to modify 
      the file <b style='font-family:"Courier New"'><a href="config/tvdxtat.properties">tvdxtat.properties</a></b>, 
      which is stored in the subdirectory config. By customizing the default configuration, you can avoid specifying 
      all arguments every time you run TVD$XTAT.</li>
  <li>Optionally, change the logging configuration. To do that, you have to modify the file 
      <b style='font-family:"Courier New"'><a href="config/logging.properties">logging.properties</a></b>, 
      which is stored in the directory config. Per default, TVD$XTAT shows errors and warnings. It isnâ€™t 
      usually necessary to change these default settings, however.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you run TVD$XTAT without arguments, you get a complete list of the available arguments with a short description
for each of them. Note that for every argument, there's a short representation (for example, -c) and a long
representation (for example, --cleanup):</p>

<pre>
<b style='font-family:"Courier New"'>usage: tvdxtat [-c no|yes] [-f <int>] [-l <int>] [-r 7|8|9|10|11|12]
               [-s no|yes] [-t &lt;template&gt;] [-w no|yes]
               [-x severe|warning|info|fine|finer] -i &lt;input&gt; -o &lt;output&gt;
 -c,--cleanup     remove temporary XML file (no|yes)
 -f,--feedback    display progress every x lines (integer number &gt;= 0, no
                  progress = 0)
 -h,--help        display this help information and exit
 -i,--input       input trace file name (valid extensions: trc|gz|zip)
 -l,--limit       limit the size of lists (e.g. number of statements) in
                  the output file (integer number &gt;= 0, unlimited = 0)
 -o,--output      output file name (a temporary XML file with the same
                  name but with the extension xml is also created)
 -r,--release     major release of the database engine that generated the
                  input trace file (7|8|9|10|11|12)
 -s,--sys         report information about SYS recursive statements
                  (no|yes)
 -t,--template    name of the XSL template used to generate the output
                  file (active|html|text)
 -v,--version     print product version and exit
 -w,--wait        report detailed information about wait events (no|yes)
 -x,--logging     logging level (severe|warning|info|fine|finer)
</b>
</pre>

<p>The function of each argument is as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b style='font-family:"Courier New"'>input</b> specifies the name of the input file. The input file must
      be either a trace file (extension.trc) or a compressed file (extension .gz or .zip) that contains one or 
      several trace files. Note, however, that only a single trace file is extracted from .zip files.</li>
  <li><b style='font-family:"Courier New"'>output</b> specifies the name of the output file. During processing, 
      a temporary XML file is created with the same name as the output file but with the extension .xml. Be 
      careful, if another file with the same name as the output file exists, it will be overwritten.</li>
  <li><b style='font-family:"Courier New"'>cleanup</b> specifies whether the temporary XML file generated during 
      processing is removed at the end. Generally, it should be set to yes. This argument is important only during 
      the development phase to check intermediate results.</li>
  <li><b style='font-family:"Courier New"'>feedback</b> specifies whether progress information is displayed. It 
      is useful during the processing of very large trace files to know the current status of the analysis. The 
      argument specifies the interval (number of lines) at which a new message will be generated. If it is set 
      to 0, no progress information is displayed.</li>
  <li><b style='font-family:"Courier New"'>help</b> specifies whether to display help information. It cannot be 
      used along with other arguments.</li>
  <li><b style='font-family:"Courier New"'>limit</b> sets the maximum number of elements present in lists (for 
      example, the lists used for SQL statements, waits, and bind variables) available in the output file. If it 
      is set to 0, there is no limit.</li>
  <li><b style='font-family:"Courier New"'>release</b> specifies the major release number (that is, 7, 8, 9, 10, 
      11 or 12) of the Oracle database engine that generated the input trace file.</li>
  <li><b style='font-family:"Courier New"'>sys</b> specifies whether information about recursive SQL statements 
      that are executed by the user SYS are available in the output file. It is commonly set to no.</li>
  <li><b style='font-family:"Courier New"'>template</b> specifies the name of the XSL template used to generate 
      the output file. By default, three templates are available: active.xsl, html.xsl and text.xsl. The first
      generates a HTML output file that requires JavaScript/jQuery; the second generates a static HTML output file;
      the third generates a text output file. The default templates can be modified and new templates can be written as well. 
      In this way, it is possible to fully customize the output file. The templates must be stored in the subdirectory templates.</li>
  <li><b style='font-family:"Courier New"'>version</b> specifies whether to display the version number of TVD$XTAT. 
      It cannot be used along with other arguments.</li>
  <li><b style='font-family:"Courier New"'>wait</b> specifies whether detailed information for wait events is shown. 
      Enabling this feature (that is, setting this argument to yes) might have a significant overhead during
      processing. Therefore, I suggest you set it initially to no. Afterward, if the basic wait information
      is not enough, you can run another analysis with it set to yes.</li>
  <li><b style='font-family:"Courier New"'>logging</b> specifies which messages are shown by the logging framework.</li>
</ul>

<p>My book, <a href="http://top.antognini.ch">Troubleshooting Oracle Performance</a>, fully describes how
   to leverage the output generated by TVD$XTAT to identify performance problems.</p>
